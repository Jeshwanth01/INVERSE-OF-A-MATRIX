# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
### Step 2: 
### Step 3: 
### Step 4: 

## Program:
#write a program to find the solution to a system of linear equations [6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]

#prgram to find the inverse of the matrix for the given matrix 
#devoleped by : Jeshwanth r
#registerNumber:2305003003
```python
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
i=np.linalg.inv(a)
print("the inverse of the matrix a is\n",i)
```  
## Output:
![exp 3 sc](https://github.com/Jeshwanth01/INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX/assets/145525167/3a565ea2-fccb-4d7b-bae1-518cd129b580)

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
